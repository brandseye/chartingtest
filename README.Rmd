# Charting Test

Provides charting libraries for BrandsEye. 

# Installing

You can install the this library using the `devtools` package:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install the devtools package
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

# Install the library
install_github("brandseye/chartingtest")

# Load the library
library(chartingtest)
```

# Example

```{r eval=FALSE}
# load the library
library(chartingtest)

# Ask for data. Tell it that you want to save to file as well
volume_sentiment("QUIR01BA", "published inthelast week", save = TRUE)
```

And this is what the data would look like in R itself (there will be similar columns in the CSV).

```{r echo=FALSE}

library(chartingtest)
volume_sentiment("QUIR01BA", "published inthelast week")
```
